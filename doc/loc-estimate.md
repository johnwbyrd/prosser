# Lines of Code Estimate

This document provides an estimate of the lines of code (LOC) required to implement the AWS Bedrock MCP and OpenAI API Proxy project.

## Core Implementation

| Component | Files | Est. LOC | Notes |
|-----------|-------|----------|-------|
| **Common Utilities** | 3 | 400 | Configuration, logging, error handling |
| **Function Entry Points** | 5 | 300 | Lambda handlers, middleware integration |
| **OpenAI API Proxy** | 7 | 800 | Route handlers, request/response transformers |
| **MCP Server** | 12 | 1,500 | Server core, capabilities, transports, session management |
| **Bedrock Integration** | 4 | 600 | Client, model mapping, streaming, token tracking |
| **Client Templates** | 2 | 100 | Cursor and VS Code configuration templates |
| **Subtotal** | 33 | **3,700** | |

## Infrastructure as Code

| Component | Files | Est. LOC | Notes |
|-----------|-------|----------|-------|
| **SAM Templates** | 4 | 500 | Main template and resource definitions |
| **Environment Config** | 2 | 100 | Environment parameters |
| **Deployment Scripts** | 4 | 200 | Deploy, undeploy, and setup scripts |
| **Subtotal** | 10 | **800** | |

## Testing & Documentation

| Component | Files | Est. LOC | Notes |
|-----------|-------|----------|-------|
| **Unit Tests** | 15 | 1,200 | Testing each component in isolation |
| **Integration Tests** | 5 | 600 | Testing end-to-end workflows |
| **Test Mocks & Fixtures** | 3 | 300 | Mock data and test configurations |
| **Code Comments** | N/A | 800 | Inline documentation |
| **Subtotal** | 23 | **2,900** | |

## Dependencies
*Note: External dependencies installed via package managers are not included in LOC counts*

| External Integration | Approach | Notes |
|----------------------|----------|-------|
| **AWS SDK for JS** | npm package | Core dependency for AWS service access |
| **Express.js** | npm package | Web framework for API implementation |
| **@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem** | npm package | Official MCP implementation for filesystem |
| **@modelcontextprotocol/server-command** | npm package | Official MCP implementation for commands |

## Total Estimates

| Category | Files | Est. LOC |
|----------|-------|----------|
| Core Implementation | 33 | 3,700 |
| Infrastructure as Code | 10 | 800 |
| Testing & Documentation | 23 | 2,900 |
| **Project Total** | **66** | **7,400** |

## Notes on Estimation

- These estimates represent clean, well-organized code following best practices
- The MCP Server has the highest LOC count due to the complexity of implementing the protocol
- Testing accounts for approximately 39% of the total codebase, reflecting a test-driven approach
- Line counts include meaningful empty lines and properly formatted code
- Infrastructure as code templates can be verbose, but SAM templates help reduce this complexity
- Client templates are minimal since they're primarily configuration files

No custom dependencies need to be hard-coded in the project, as the design leverages existing npm packages for core functionality. All required dependencies would be managed through package.json files and Lambda layers.

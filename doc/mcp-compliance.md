# MCP Protocol Compliance

## Overview
- This document outlines our compliance with the Model Context Protocol (MCP) specification
- Official MCP specification: [Model Context Protocol GitHub](https://github.com/ModelContext/protocol)
- Our implementation adheres to the standard with specific extensions noted below

## Core Protocol Compliance

### Transport Layer
- **Standard Compliance**: Full compliance with HTTP and SSE transport mechanisms as defined in the specification
- **Deviation**: Connection management implemented through AWS Lambda response streaming
  - Enables long-running connections (up to 15 minutes) in serverless context
  - Uses API Gateway + Lambda streaming response instead of traditional server SSE
  - Client experience remains identical to standard implementation

### Session Management
- **Standard Compliance**: Adheres to session creation and lifecycle as specified
- **Deviation**: Session state persistence implemented across Lambda invocations
  - Session state stored in DynamoDB with on-demand capacity
  - Maintains stateless Lambda functions for scalability
  - Transparent to client implementation

### Capability Advertisement
- **Standard Compliance**: All standard capability advertisement mechanisms implemented
- **Deviation**: None

### Message Format
- **Standard Compliance**: All message formats follow the specification exactly
- **Deviation**: None

## Tool Implementation Compliance

### Filesystem Tools
- **Standard Compliance**: Uses official `@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem` implementation
- **Deviation**: Added security boundaries for multi-tenant environments

### Command Execution
- **Standard Compliance**: Uses official `@modelcontextprotocol/server-command` implementation
- **Deviation**: Added command whitelisting and execution restrictions

### Content Generation
- **Standard Compliance**: Follows MCP tool specification format
- **Deviation**: Implementation connects to AWS Bedrock instead of local models
  - Streaming responses from Bedrock piped through Lambda response streaming
  - Supports full 15-minute execution time for long generations

## Protocol Extensions

### Authentication Extensions
- Extended authentication to support AWS IAM in addition to API keys
- These extensions do not modify standard protocol flows

### Telemetry Extensions
- Added token usage tracking capabilities
- Extensions use the standard extension mechanism defined in the spec

### Multi-Model Support
- Added model selection capabilities
- Implemented as standard tools following the protocol specification

## Client Compatibility Notes

- Fully compatible with standard MCP clients (Cursor, VS Code)
- No client-side modifications required to use standard functionality
- Extended functionality available through standard configuration mechanisms
